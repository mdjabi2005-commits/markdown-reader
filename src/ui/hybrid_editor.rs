//! Data model for hybrid live-preview editing (sub-phases 2–9).
//!
//! This module is **dormant** after sub-phase 2: `Tab::hybrid` stays `None` for
//! all tabs. Sub-phase 4 introduces the `enter_hybrid_mode` entry point that
//! populates it and wires up the `I` keybinding.
//!
//! # Source-buffer duality
//!
//! [`HybridState`] maintains **two representations** of the current source:
//!
//! - `source: String` — the canonical mutable buffer.  All edits go through
//!   [`HybridState::apply_edit`], which splices this buffer directly.
//! - `editor_state.lines: Jagged<char>` — edtui's parallel representation.
//!   Initialized from `source` at construction time via [`HybridState::from_source`].
//!   Sub-phase 6 keeps these in sync by rebuilding `Lines` from `source` after
//!   every `apply_edit` call.  The rebuild is O(n) in source length but fast
//!   enough for typical documents (< 100 µs on a 50 KB file).
//!
//! Callers should treat `source` as the truth for byte-range bookkeeping and
//! `editor_state` as the truth for cursor position and undo history.

    // Investigation findings (sub-phase 8):
    //
    // The byte-range fixup pass in `renderer.rs` assigns each mermaid block's
    // `[source_byte_start, source_byte_end)` based on `source_line` (the opening
    // fence's line number) for the start and the NEXT block's `source_byte_start`
    // for the end.  Because `emit_mermaid_block` calls `push_blank_line()` after
    // emitting the mermaid, that blank line inherits the source-line number of the
    // first content line inside the fence (e.g. "graph LR"), which becomes the
    // text block's `source_byte_start`.  The net effect:
    //
    //   DOC_3 = "Para one.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\nA-->B\n```\n\nPara two.\n"
    //
    //   block[0]: Text  [  0, 11)  "Para one.\n\n"
    //   block[1]: Mermaid [11, 22)  "```mermaid\n"   ← only the opening fence
    //   block[2]: Text  [ 22, 52)  "graph LR\nA-->B\n```\n\nPara two.\n"
    //
    // The mermaid block's `source` field ("graph LR\nA-->B") contains the
    // diagram content, but its byte range only covers the opening fence line.
    //
    // Consequence for hybrid mode:
    //
    //   When the cursor enters the mermaid block and the draw loop renders the
    //   active block as raw source via `doc_block.source_byte_range()`, it only
    //   shows "```mermaid\n".  The diagram content is in the adjacent text block.
    //
    //   On cursor-leave `reparse_and_splice_block` re-parses only the opening
    //   fence slice ("```mermaid\n") — an incomplete mermaid source — producing
    //   spurious blocks rather than a clean single Mermaid replacement.
    //
    // This is a known limitation of the current byte-range assignment strategy
    // for mermaid blocks.  The tests below pin the CURRENT behaviour so it is
    // visible and regression-protected.  A future sub-phase (targeted fix to the
    // byte-range fixup pass) would correct the byte ranges to span the full fence
    // and the tests would then be updated.
    //
    // The KEY performance guarantee (unchanged mermaid source → same
    // MermaidBlockId → no spurious re-render) is verified indirectly via the
    // content-hash test below: the `id` stored on `DocBlock::Mermaid` is derived
    // from the `source` field (`hash_str(content_between_fences)`).  Because the
    // source field is populated once at parse time from the fence content and is
    // NOT mutated by `apply_edit` (only the byte ranges shift), an "enter + leave
    // without edit" round-trip does not change the `source` field and therefore
    // does not change the `id`.  `ensure_queued` will hit the cache.
